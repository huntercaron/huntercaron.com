                    <p>Turnip is an app with the goal of optimizing the creative mind via your personal assistant, Timmy the turnip. It utilizes an <strong>efficient and personable design language</strong> to encourage you to be the best you can be.</p>
                    <p class="proto-desc">This project was my first foray into <strong>high fidelity rapid prototyping</strong> with Framer JS and I instantly fell in love. The ability to user-test with a nearly fully functional prototype was incredibly useful in creating this project.</p>

                            <p>Creative thinkers have their minds at full speed for most of their day, or at least that is what they attempt to do. Upon doing some research I found that many creatives were <strong>losing steam throughout the day.</strong></p>
                            <p>Another large problem is that many creatives find themselves sitting at their desk for the better part of the day, which <strong>impacts them not only mentally but physically as well</strong> in the long run.</p>

                            <p>After some research I realized that a well known technique to boost productivity is the built upon the same idea as one used to counteract the negatives of sitting all day!</p>
                            <p>Enter: <strong>Pulse and Pause</strong>. A term coined by Tony Schwartz to describe the technique of working in bursts then taking a break to improve productivity, which is also similar to the popular pomodoro technique.</p>
                            <p>The goal now was to create an app as simple and efficient as the idea itself.</p>
